          <p>You can't know where you are, until you know where you've been! Keep track of your plant's progress to diagnose plantybois and reach your plantygoals. Plants have a finite amount of things they can DO - really you can square down your inputs
            to: Environment, Water, Light, How much you sing to them in the dawn light upon the fourth moon. It doesn't take much to write down those lullaby lyrics to make your plantyboi a happyboi!</p>

          <hr>
          <p> Take our plantyquiz to see which plant would work for your plantylifestyle. We thought about it all - what kind of heater do you have? Do you run hot or cold? Do you want to water it all the time? Do you want to forget about your plant only
            to be delighted again when its droppy leaves perk up with a little care? Do you live in a deep dark hole beacuse the capitalist society has made the rent too damn high? - we have a plantyboi for you.

          <h4>About plantyboi</h4>
          <hr>
          <p>Plantyboi was created at the behest of a bunch of planty questions being fielded by Breamons from all the planty parents who were her friends and coworkers. After turning her grey cubicle into a veritable plantyjungle, passers by kept on coming
            with their crispy leaves,and moldy roots, and other maladies for healing by the original plantyparent. After fixing some problems and helping turn some black thumbs into green ones, Breamons decided to keep track of, not only her plantyfriends,
            but the plantyanswers and scenarios. So here you are. The plantyknowledge dump. Plants love a good compost pile. </p>
